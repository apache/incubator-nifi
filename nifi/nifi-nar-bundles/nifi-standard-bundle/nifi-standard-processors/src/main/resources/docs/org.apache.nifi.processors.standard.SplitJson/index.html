<!-- Processor Documentation ================================================== -->
<h2>Description:</h2>

<p>
    This processor splits a JSON File into multiple, separate FlowFiles for an array element specified by a JsonPath
    expression.
    Each generated FlowFile is comprised of an element of the specified array and transferred to relationship 'split,'
    with the original file transferred to the 'original' relationship. If the specified JsonPath is not found or
    does not evaluate to an array element, the original file is routed to 'failure' and no files are generated.
</p>

<p>
    <strong>Note:</strong> The underlying JsonPath library loads the entirety of the streamed content into and performs
    result evaluations in memory. Accordingly, it is important to consider the anticipated profile of content being
    evaluated by this processor and the hardware supporting it especially when working against large JSON documents.
</p>

<strong>Properties:</strong>
</p>

<p>
    In the list below, the names of required properties appear in bold. Any other properties (not in bold) are
    considered optional. If a property has a default value, it is indicated. If a property supports the use of the NiFi
    Expression Language (or simply, "expression language"), that is also indicated.
</p>
<ul>
    <li><strong>JsonPath Expression</strong>
        <ul>
            <li>A JsonPath expression that indicates the array element to split into JSON/scalar fragments.</li>
            <li>Supports expression language: false</li>
        </ul>
    </li>
</ul>

<p>
    <strong>Relationships:</strong>
</p>
<ul>
    <li>failure
        <ul>
            <li>If a FlowFile fails processing for any reason (for example, the FlowFile is not valid JSON or the
                specified path does not exist) and does not go down the original relationship.
            </li>
        </ul>
    </li>
    <li>original
        <ul>
            <li>If FlowFiles are successfully split, a copy of the original FlowFile follows this relationship.</li>
        </ul>
    </li>
    <li>split
        <ul>
            <li>If FlowFiles are successfully split into one or more files, those split files follow this
                relationship.
            </li>
        </ul>
    </li>
</ul>
