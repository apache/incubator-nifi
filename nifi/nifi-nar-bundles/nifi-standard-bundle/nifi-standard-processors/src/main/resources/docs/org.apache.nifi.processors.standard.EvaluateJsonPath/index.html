<!-- Processor Documentation ================================================== -->
<h2>Description:</h2>

<p>
    Evaluates one or more JsonPath expressions against the content of a FlowFile. The results of those expressions are
    assigned to FlowFile Attributes or are written to the content of the FlowFile itself, depending on configuration of
    the Processor. JsonPaths are entered by adding user-defined properties; the name of the property maps to the
    Attribute Name into which the result will be placed (if the Destination is flowfile-attribute; otherwise, the
    property name is ignored). The value of the property must be a valid JsonPath expression. If the JsonPath evaluates
    to a JSON array or JSON object and the Return Type is set to 'scalar' the FlowFile will be unmodified and will be
    routed to failure. A Return Type of JSON can return scalar values if the provided JsonPath evaluates to the
    specified value and will be routed as a match. If Destination is 'flowfile-content' and the JsonPath does not
    evaluate to a defined path, the FlowFile will be routed to 'unmatched' without having its contents modified. If
    Destination is flowfile-attribute and the expression matches nothing, attributes will be created with empty
    strings as the value, and the FlowFile will always be routed to 'matched.'
</p>

<p>
    <strong>Note:</strong> The underlying JsonPath library loads the entirety of the streamed content into and performs
    result evaluations in memory. Accordingly, it is important to consider the anticipated profile of content being
    evaluated by this processor and the hardware supporting it especially when working against large JSON documents.
</p>

<p>
    <strong>Properties:</strong>
</p>

<p>
    In the list below, the names of required properties appear in bold.
    Any other properties (not in bold) are considered optional. If a
    property has a default value, it is indicated. If a property
    supports the use of the NiFi Expression Language (or simply,
    "expression language"), that is also indicated.
</p>

<p>
    <strong>Modifies Attributes:</strong>
</p>

<p>
    This processor adds user-defined attributes if the &lt;Destination&gt; property is set to
    <code>flowfile-attribute</code>.
</p>


<ul>
    <li>
        <strong>Destination</strong>
        <ul>
            <li>Indicates whether the results of the JsonPath evaluation are
                written to the FlowFile content or a FlowFile attribute; if using
                attribute, the attribute's name must be specified in the value of
                the Attribute Name property.
            </li>
            <li>
                Valid values are:
                <ul>
                    <li>flowfile-content</li>
                    <li>flowfile-attribute</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li>Default value: flowfile-content</li>
            <li>Supports expression language: false</li>
        </ul>
    </li>
    <li>
        <strong>Return Type</strong>
        <ul>
            <li>Indicates the desired return type of the Xpath expressions.
                Selecting 'auto-detect' will set the return type to 'json' for a
                Destination of 'flowfile-content', and 'scalar' for a Destination of
                'flowfile-attribute'.")
            </li>
            <li>
                Valid values are:
                <ul>
                    <li>auto-detect</li>
                    <li>json</li>
                    <li>scalar</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li>Default value: auto-detect</li>
            <li>Supports expression language: false</li>
        </ul>
    </li>
    <li>
        user-defined properties
        <ul>
            <li>The name of the attribute to put the JsonPath result into if
                flowfile-attribute is used as the value for the Destination
                property; if using flowfile-content as the value for the
                Destination property, this value is ignored.
            </li>
            <li>Supports expression language: false</li>
        </ul>
    </li>
</ul>

<p>
    <strong>Relationships:</strong>
</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        failure
        <ul>
            <li>If the JsonPath cannot be evaluated against the content of the
                FlowFile, then the FlowFile follows this relationship. For
                example, if the FlowFile does not contain valid JSON.
            </li>
        </ul>
    </li>
    <li>
        matched
        <ul>
            <li>If the JsonPath is successfully evaluated and the FlowFile is
                modified as a result, then the FlowFile follows this
                relationship.
            </li>
        </ul>
    </li>
    <li>
        unmatched
        <ul>
            <li>If the JsonPath does not match the content of the FlowFile, then
                the FlowFile follows this relationship.
            </li>
        </ul>
    </li>
</ul>
