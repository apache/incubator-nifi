## General Info

### Nx

If you are unfamiliar Nx, you can learn more at https://nx.dev/getting-started/intro. They provide many solid resources to get you up to speed.

_From Nx:_

> We created Nx because developers struggle to configure, maintain and especially integrate various tools and frameworks.
> Setting up a system that works well for a handful of developers and at the same time, easily scales up to an entire organization is hard.
> This includes setting up low-level build tooling, configuring fast CI, and keeping your codebase healthy, up-to-date, and maintainable.

## Development server

Run `npx nx serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The application will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Code scaffolding

Run `npx nx generate <generator> <<generator args>>`.

Or better yet, have a look at the [Nx documentation on integrating with IDEs](https://nx.dev/features/integrate-with-editors)

## Build

Run `npx nx build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory.

## Running unit tests

Run `npx nx test` to execute the unit tests via Jest

## Linting the codebase

Run `npx nx lint` to execute lint

## Further help

To get more help on the Nx CLI use `npx nx --help`.
