<h1>PutSnowflakeInternalStage</h1>

<h3>Description</h3>
<p>
    The PutSnowflakeInternalStage processor can upload a file to a Snowflake internal stage. This stage needs to be set up in your Snowflake account.
    The processor requires an upstream connection and the incoming FlowFiles' content will be uploaded to the stage. The attributes "filename" and "path" are used to provide a prefix and file name for your file in the stage.
    While the processor can be used by itself, it's usually recommended to connect it to a StartSnowflakeIngest processor to put the uploaded file into your Snowflake table via a pipe.
