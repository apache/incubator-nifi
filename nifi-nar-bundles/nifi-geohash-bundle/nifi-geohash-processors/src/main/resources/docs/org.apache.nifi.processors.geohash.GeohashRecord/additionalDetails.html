<h1>Overview</h1>
<p>
    A Geohash value corresponds to an specific area with pre-defined granularity, and is widely used in identifying,
    representing, and indexing geospatial objects.
    This GeohashRecord processor provides the ability to encode and decode Geohashes with desired format and precision.
</p>
<h3>Formats supported</h3>
<p>
<ul>
    <li>Base32 string: The most commonly used alphanumeric version. It is compact and more human-readale by discarding
        some letters(such as "a" and "o", "i" and "l") that might cause confusion.
    </li>
    <li>Binary String: This format is generated by directly interleaving latitude and longitude binary string. The even
        bits in the binary strings corresponds to the longitude, while the odd digits corresponds to the latitude.
    </li>
    <li>Long Integer: Although this 64-bit integer format is not human-readale, it can be calculated very fast and is
        more effcient.
    </li>
</ul>
</p>
<h3>Precision supported</h3>

<p>
    In <b>Encode</b> mode, users specify the desired precision level, which should be an integer number between 1 and
    12. A greater level will generate a longer Geohash with higher precision.
</p>
<p>
    In Decode mode, users are not asked to provide a precision level because this information is contained in the length
    of Geohash values given.
