<h3>File uploading and cleanup process</h3>
<h4>There are two ways of file uploading:</h4>
    <ol>
    <li>Inline replacement, no prefix property provided.</li>
    <li>Using a temporary file, prefix property provided.</li>

<h4>New file upload</h4>

<ol>
    <li>An empty file is created.</li>
    <li>Content is appended to file.</li>
    <li>In case append failure the file is deleted.</li>
    <li>In case file deletion failure the empty file remains on the server.</li>
</ol>

<h4>Existing file upload</h4>

<ul>
    <li>Processors with "fail" conflict resolution strategy will be directed to "Failure" relationship.</li>
     <li>Processors with "ignore" conflict resolution strategy will be directed to "Success" relationship.</li>
    <li>Processors with "replace" conflict resolution strategy:</li>

    <ol>
        <li>An empty file overwrites the existing file, the original file is lost.</li>
        <li>Content is appended to file.</li>
        <li>In case append failure the file is deleted.</li>
        <li>In case file deletion failure the empty file remains on the server.</li>
    </ol>
</ul>

<h4>When prefix is provided</h4>
<p>Setting the same prefix in the ListAzureDataLakeStorage processor temporary files won't appear in the list results.</p>

    <li>In case of appending or renaming failure the temp file is deleted, the original file remains intact.</li>
    <li>In case of file deletion failure both temp file and original file remain on the server.</li>
</ol>
