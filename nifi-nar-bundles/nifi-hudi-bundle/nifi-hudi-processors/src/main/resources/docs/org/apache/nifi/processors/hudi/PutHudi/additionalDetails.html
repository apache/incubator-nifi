        <h1>PutHudi</h1>

        <h3>Description</h3>
        <p>
            Apache Hudi is a transactional data lake platform that brings database and data warehouse capabilities to the data lake.
            The PutHudi processor is capable of pushing data into Hudi tables using the Hudi Java Client.
        </p>

        <h3>Key Generator</h3>
        <p>
            Every record is uniquely identified by a primary key, which is a pair of record key and partition path where the record belongs to.
            To determine which key generator should be used the processor is going through the following decision order:
            <ul>
                <li>The processor tries to read the "hoodie.table.keygenerator.class" property from the target table's configuration and set it to the writer configuration</li>
                <li>The processor checks the "hoodie.datasource.write.keygenerator.type" property in the writer's configuration</li>
                <li>The processor tries to infer the key generator type from the "hoodie.datasource.write.partitionpath.field" and "hoodie.datasource.write.recordkey.field" properties</li>
            </ul>

        </p>

        <h3>Configuration</h3>
        <p>
            Configuration files and entries can be provided in different ways to the processor. The configuration entry override hierarchy is the following:
            <ul>
                <li>Configuration provided thourgh the processors "Hudi Configuration Resources" property</li>
                <li>Configuration entries mapped from the target table's configruation</li>
                <ul>
                    <li><code>"hoodie.table.recordkey.fields"                         ->  "hoodie.datasource.write.recordkey.field"</code></li>
                    <li><code>"hoodie.table.partition.fields"                         ->  "hoodie.datasource.write.partitionpath.field"</code></li>
                    <li><code>"hoodie.table.keygenerator.class"                       ->  "hoodie.datasource.write.keygenerator.class"</code></li>
                    <li><code>"hoodie.datasource.write.hive_style_partitioning"       ->  "hoodie.datasource.write.hive_style_partitioning"</code></li>
                    <li><code>"hoodie.datasource.write.partitionpath.urlencode"       ->  "hoodie.datasource.write.partitionpath.urlencode"</code></li>
                </ul>
                <li>Configuration entries provided through dynamic properties</li>
            </ul>
        </p>
