<h1>Accessing Google Drive from NiFi</h1>

<p>
    This processor uses Google Cloud credentials for authentication to access Google Drive.
    The following steps are required to prepare the Google Cloud and Google Drive accounts for the processors:
</p>
<ol>
    <li><b>Enable Google Drive API in Google Cloud</b> - Follow instructions at
        https://developers.google.com/workspace/guides/enable-apis
        and search for 'Google Drive API'.
    </li>
    <li><b>Grant access to Google Drive folder</b> - In Google Cloud Console navigate to IAM & Admin -> Service
        Accounts. Take a note of the email of the service account you are going to use.
        Navigate to the folder to be listed in Google Drive. Right-click on the Folder -> Share. Enter the
        service account email.
    </li>
    <li><b>Find Folder ID</b> - Enter the folder to be listed. The URL in your browser will include the ID at the end of
        the URL.
        For example, if the URL were https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1trTraPVCnX5_TNwO8d9P_bz278xWOmGm, the
        Folder ID would be 1trTraPVCnX5_TNwO8d9P_bz278xWOmGm
    </li>
    <li><b>Set Folder ID in 'Folder ID' property</b>
    </li>
</ol>
