<h1>Google Cloud Vision - Start Annotate Images Operation</h1>

<p>
	Prerequisites
<ul>
	<li>Make sure Vision API is enabled and the account you are using has rights to use</li>
	<li>Make sure input image(s) are available in GCS</li>
</ul>
</p>
<h3>Usage</h3>
<p>
StartGcpVisionAnnotateImagesOperation is designed to trigger image annotation operation. This processor should be used in pair with GetGcpVisionAnnotateImagesOperationStatus Processor.
FlowFile will contain the serialized response that contains the result and additional metadata as it is documented in Google Vision API Reference.
</p>
<h3>Payload</h3>
<p>
	The JSON Payload is a request in json format that documented in <a href="https://cloud.google.com/vision/docs/reference/rest/v1/images/asyncBatchAnnotate" target="_blank">Google Vision REST API reference </a>.
	Payload can be feed to the processor via <code>JSON Payload</code> property or as a flow file content. Property has higher precedence over FlowFile content.
	JSON payload template example:
</p>

<code>
    <pre>
{
	"requests": [{
		"image": {
			"source": {
				"imageUri": "gs://..."
			}
		},
		"features": [{
			"type": "DOCUMENT_TEXT_DETECTION",
			"maxResults": 4
		}]
	}],
	"outputConfig": {
		"gcsDestination": {
			"uri": "gs://..."
		},
		"batchSize": 2
	}
}
    </pre>
</code>
<h3>Features types</h3>
<ul>
	<li>TEXT_DETECTION: Optical character recognition (OCR) for an image; text recognition and conversion to machine-coded text. Identifies and extracts UTF-8 text in an image.</li>
	<li>DOCUMENT_TEXT_DETECTION: Optical character recognition (OCR) for a file (PDF/TIFF) or dense text image; dense text recognition and conversion to machine-coded text.</li>
	<li>LANDMARK_DETECTION: Provides the name of the landmark, a confidence score and a bounding box in the image for the landmark.</li>
	<li>LOGO_DETECTION: Provides a textual description of the entity identified, a confidence score, and a bounding polygon for the logo in the file.</li>
	<li>LABEL_DETECTION: Provides generalized labels for an image.</li>
	<li>etc.</li>
</ul>
