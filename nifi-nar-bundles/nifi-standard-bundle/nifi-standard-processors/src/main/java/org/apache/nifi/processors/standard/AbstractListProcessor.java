/**
 * <p>
 * An Abstract Processor that is intended to simplify the coding required in order to perform Listing operations of remote resources.
 * Those remote resources may be files, "objects", "messages", or any other sort of entity that may need to be listed in such a way that
 * we identity the entity only once. Each of these objects, messages, etc. is referred to as an "entity" for the scope of this Processor.
 * </p>
 *
 * <p>
 * This class is responsible for triggering the listing to occur, filtering the results returned such that only new (unlisted) entities
 * or entities that have been modified will be emitted from the Processor.
 * </p>
 *
 * <p>
 * In order to make use of this abstract class, the entities listed must meet the following criteria:
 * </p>
 *
 * <ul>
 *  <li>
 *      Entity must have a timestamp associated with it. This timestamp is used to determine if entities are "new" or not. Any entity that is
 *      returned by the listing will be considered "new" if the timestamp is later than the latest timestamp pulled.
 *  </li>
 *  <li>
 *      Entity must have a unique identifier. This is used in conjunction with the timestamp in order to determine whether or not the entity is
 *      new. If the timestamp of an entity is before the latest timestamp pulled, then the entity is not considered new. If the timestamp is later
 *      than the last timestamp pulled, then the entity is considered new. If the timestamp is equal to the latest timestamp pulled, then the entity's
 *      identifier is compared to all of the entity identifiers that have that same timestamp in order to determine whether or not the entity has been
 *      seen already.
 *  </li>
 *  <li>
 *      Entity must have a user-readable name that can be used for logging purposes.
 *  </li>
 * </ul>
 *
 * <p>
 * This class persists state across restarts so that even if NiFi is restarted, duplicates will not be pulled from the remote system. This is performed using
 * two different mechanisms. First, state is stored locally. This allows the system to be restarted and begin processing where it left off. The state that is
 * stored is the latest timestamp that has been pulled (as determined by the timestamps of the entities that are returned), as well as the unique identifier of
 * each entity that has that timestamp. See the section above for information about how these pieces of information are used in order to determine entity uniqueness.
 * </p>
 *
 * <p>
 * In addition to storing state locally, the Processor exposes an optional <code>Distributed Cache Service</code> property. In standalone deployment of NiFi, this is
 * not necessary. However, in a clustered environment, subclasses of this class are expected to be run only on primary node. While this means that the local state is
 * accurate as long as the primary node remains constant, the primary node in the cluster can be changed. As a result, if running in a clustered environment, it is
 * recommended that this property be set. This allows the same state that is described above to also be replicated across the cluster. If this property is set, then
 * on restart the Processor will not begin listing until it has retrieved an updated state from this service, as it does not know whether or not another node has
 * modified the state in the mean time.
 * </p>
 *
 * <p>
 * For each new entity that is listed, the Processor will send a FlowFile to the 'success' relationship. The FlowFile will have no content but will have some set
 * of attributes (defined by the concrete implementation) that can be used to fetch those remote resources or interact with them in whatever way makes sense for
 * the configured dataflow.
 * </p>
 *
 * <p>
 * Subclasses are responsible for the following:
 * </p>
 *
 * <ul>
 * <li>
 * Perform a listing of remote resources. The subclass will implement the {@link #performListing(ProcessContext, Long)} method, which creates a listing of all
 * entities on the remote system that have timestamps later than the provided timestamp. If the entities returned have a timestamp before the provided one, those
 * entities will be filtered out. It is therefore not necessary to perform the filtering of timestamps but is provided in order to give the implementation the ability
 * to filter those resources on the server side rather than pulling back all of the information, if it makes sense to do so in the concrete implementation.
 * </li>
 * <li>
 * Creating a Map of attributes that are applicable for an entity. The attributes that are assigned to each FlowFile are exactly those returned by the
 * {@link #createAttributes(ListableEntity, ProcessContext)}.
 * </li>
 * <li>
 * Returning the configured path. Many resources can be comprised of a "path" (or a "container" or "bucket", etc.) as well as name or identifier that is unique only
 * within that path. The {@link #getPath(ProcessContext)} method is responsible for returning the path that is currently being polled for entities. If this does concept
 * does not apply for the concrete implementation, it is recommended that the concrete implementation return "." or "/" for all invocations of this method.
 * </li>
 * <li>
 * Determining when the listing must be cleared. It is sometimes necessary to clear state about which entities have already been ingested, as the result of a user
 * changing a property value. The {@link #isListingResetNecessary(PropertyDescriptor)} method is responsible for determining when the listing needs to be reset by returning
 * a boolean indicating whether or not a change in the value of the provided property should trigger the timestamp and identifier information to be cleared.
 * </li>
 * </ul>
