<h2>EmbeddedHazelcastCacheManager</h2>

<p>
    This service starts and manages an embedded Hazelcast instance. The instance needs to listen on a port for
    possible clients to join in. The cache manager will not join via this port but directly reaches data using the embedded
    server instance. This behaviour comes from Hazelcast and not to be prevented but not used as the embedded manager
    is intended to be serve as an internal cache storage. However, be aware: this might make the instance reachable
    within the same network and it is possible for clients to join.
</p>

<p>
    The properties the service supports are provided in order to make it possible to run multiple instances of Hazelcast
    (whatever if via EmbeddedHazelcastCacheManager or externally) without any interference. If no further instances are in
    use, the port-specific properties and the cluster name is not necessary to be set.
</p>

<p>
    For providing flexibility with port usage, the Hazelcast provides a "port auto increment" feature. With this,
    when Hazelcast starting, it tries to use further ports within a range when the original port is in use. Further details
    about Hazelcast port configuration might be found <a href="https://docs.hazelcast.org/docs/4.0.1/manual/html-single/index.html#port">here</a>.
    This feature is controlled by "Hazelcast Port Count" and "Hazelcast Port Auto Increment". In order to avoid
    unintentional usage of the feature, if any of these properties are defined, the port must be explicitly set.
