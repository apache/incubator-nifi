<h2>EmbeddedHazelcastCacheManager</h2>

<p>
    This service starts and manages an embedded Hazelcast instance. The cache manager has direct accesses to the
    instance - and the data stored in it. However, the instance sill opens a port for potential clients to join and
    this cannot be prevented. Note that this might leave the instance open for rogue clients to join.
</p>

<p>
    It is possible to have multiple independent Hazelcast instances on the same host (whether via EmbeddedHazelcastCacheManager
    or externally) without any interference by setting the properties accordingly. If there are no other instances, the port number
    and cluster name are not necessary to be set. (Default values will be used instead.)
</p>

<p>
    The service supports multiple ways to set up a Hazelcast cluster. This is controlled by the property, named "Hazelcast High
    Availability Mode". The following values might be used:
</p>

<h3>None</h3>

<p>
    This is the default value. Used when sharing data between nodes is not required. With this value, every NiFi node
    in the cluster (if it is clustered) connects to its local Hazelcast server only. The Hazelcast servers do not form a cluster.
</p>

<h3>Cluster</h3>

<p>
    Can be used only in clustered node. Using this mode will result a single Hazelcast cluster consisting of the embedded instances
    of all the NiFi nodes. This mode requires all Hazelcast servers listening on the same port. Having different port numbers
    (based on expression for example) would prevent the cluster from forming.
</p>

<p>
    The controller service automatically gathers the host list from the NiFi cluster itself when it is enabled. It is
    not required for all the nodes to have been successfully joined at this point, but the join must have been initiated. When
    the controller service is enabled at the start of the NiFi instance, the enabling of the service will be prevented until the
    node is considered clustered.
</p>

<p>
    Hazelcast can accept nodes that join at a later time. As the new node has a comprehensive list of the expected instances - including the
    already existing ones and itself - Hazelcast will be able to reach the expected state. Beware: this may take significant time.
    <i>Note: as this is provided by Hazelcast, it is not guaranteed that later releases will have the exact same behaviour!</i>
</p>

<h3>Explicit</h3>

<p>
    Can be used only in clustered node. Explicit HA mode allows more control over the Hazelcast cluster members. Like Cluster HA mode,
    this mode works with a list of Hazelcast servers, but instance discovery is not automatic.
</p>

<p>
    This mode uses property named "Hazelcast Instances" to determine the members of the Hazelcast clusters. This list of hosts must contain
    all the instances expected to be part of the cluster. The instance list must contain only hosts which are part of the NiFi cluster. The
    port specified in the "Hazelcast Port" will be used as Hazelcast server port.
</p>

<p>
    In case the current node is not part of the instance list, the service will start a Hazelcast client. The client than will connect
    to the Hazelcast addresses specified in the instance list. Users of the service should not perceive any difference in functionality.
